            The internet is an extension of everybody's minds and thoughts, the closest we've come to a collective unconscious made flesh.<br>
            This means the internet is an extension of our current thought, but the fact that these thoughts get to interact together a lot more frequently and with even more thoughts means mutations and mutations upon mutations of thought are allowed much more ability to be created, be discovered and take hold.
            The Internet can (thankfully still) be imagined as our best material presentation of the bordering-on-decentralized - while the giant companies still work to have everyone rely on them so that they can continue to have as much dominance over the infrastructure of our net as possible, and many including my own university concede, admittedly for very practical reasons like off-loading the security and maintenance so that they can focus on the minutia, if I'm to quote <a href=https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/>a text</a> interlinked with the course that brought this website into existence: it is supposed to be an interconnected web that works for people, not profit, and handing leverage to those who mainly seek legitimacy for the sake of profit is a dangerous game, as things can quickly deteriorate into seeking the maximization thereof.<br>
            While often considered obtuse, the internet was built on open source software, and today we still rely on <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">passion projects</a>, sometimes praying (or demanding) that others do the work to maintain them for free, and it's important and part of the opportunity web for people to contribute as much as possible, if not giving back through their own contributions, through donations to the projects that benefit them.
            But the internet is most valuable when it can lift even those that society has left behind. It <a href=https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/we-only-learnt-of-our-sons-secret-online-life-after-he-died-at-20-rj3bqfnqn>has been shown</a> that it can <a href=https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/12/11/social-media-continue-to-be-important-political-outlets-for-black-americans>lend minorities</a> including the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28616856/">neurodivergent</a> better tools of connecting with others over the things they care about and help give order in a chaotic world, and there are new people seeking out a world beyond their regular (sometimes extreme) seclusion literally every day, serving to let people find reason to be part of society in spite of potential anxieties or abuse. Often case, people are allowed to escape the nearby community's norms into a safer environment to communicate and test their own norms and desires, expanding on themselves in return while showing the legitimacy of a digital world being as valid as an analog one. Because one of the powers of the internet is evening the playingfield in terms of allowing opinions and matters to be heard, though it can be argued that people who dedicate themselves to mediums that require more resources such as time and money have complicated ways of persuading their listeners better, it is harder to dismiss people for what they look like and easier to judge them based off of their ideas.<br>
            The net also allows a furthering of the conversation and tools to quickly bring large swathes of those who aren't in the know up to speed on where the conversation's furthest discourse is, what thoughts we've collectively decided are bullshit and the arguments we are currently pitting to understand what is better (though often just more convincing, where the internet also is a battle of bringing people up to speed on best practices, usually pointing to the academic world with a fundamental trust that they have been trying to pursue truth themself). Watching the internet over time and the various people in it can lead you to see groups are allowed to collectively come to conclusions through synthesis, and progress to higher plateaus together, and you watch concepts and thoughts rage war, rise, fall and ocassionally get forgotten through this endless noisechamber as smaller groups and larger groups occasionally crash or someone shouts out into the vast space with an idea they don't find expressed enough. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JP7DbzxRK8">contemporary conversation</a> on discourse that does contrast my own expression, using youtube channel Jubilee as a springboard they highlight current common issues and arguing for better ways to communicate than the current active pitting against that some channels/hosts utilize, as we can risk engaging in 'fake conversation' still. There is in general an elephant in the room of the digital having to come to terms with the established literature in the analog, both in books whose information never makes its way into the internet no matter how many wikipedia articles you have around a topic, and in general understanding the best-practices of information-gathering-and-understanding (not only what's good data and how to get good data, but how to read data well), and also being able to tackle today's problem of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10322198/">information overload at the same time while not flattening the conversation by oversimplifying solutions or problems.</a> (A problem you might come to blame me for perpetuating in a second.)

            The internet has always been a tool though, and our current conditions, political, historical, material, everything that brings us to be who we are in this moment leads us to use the internet in a certain way, as witnessed by our current state of internet being different from the beginning of 2.0.
            <br>For greater critique of some of the internet's harms and failings (and the tricks of the worse actors), I'll highlight what I find to be great conversation-starters I've seen recently,
            <br><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPyJBJTHyO0">How I Fell Out of Love With Facebook</a>, a video that reflects a lot on the creator's own use of Facebook and the harm the company has done in the name of connecting people. The video even makes a point to how one of the open net's most priced tools, Open Sourcing can be utilized to shut down competition with Meta's handling of AI.
            <br>In March 2024, one of the founders of the WWW <a href=>reflected</a> (as he does a lot) on the internet, now 35 years old, calling out dysfunction and the acceleration of the worsening of everyone's digital habitat he fears to come through for-profit powers' need to exploit every node (person) able to become part of their system.
            <br>I don't think I can mention this topic specifically in 2024 without highlighting a speech made by the person who coined <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/17/hack-the-planet/#how-about-a-nice-game-of-chess">Enshittification</a>, an ongoing discussion on how a lot of our services have lulled people in with the promise of good design and communication before deliberately deterioating the main service for end-users in the hope of squeezing an extra % of profit out of the increasingly dissatisfied, able only to hold due to every user keeping the users they're connected to hostage.<br>
            Last but not least, Remember to <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSj_K4RkNh0>acknowledge the medium</a> you absorb through as much as the media, while the video also is a means to make us aware of the constant need for evolution in the various dimensions we develop discussion, and the counterargumentative elements of these dimensions.
            <br><br>It is important to acknowledge how bad actors can use these powerful tools for communication and world-shaping (and what it looks like they're going to commit to in the future), in part as a way to counteract them. Having the manual inside of yourself is the first step.
